# YSDA-CPU-inference
### Quantized inference on CPU (int8 / int4 / mixed precision )      
The aim of this project is to investigate whether the int8 architecture can provide acceleration compared to the fp16/fp32 architecture (in particular, there must be good INT8 computing structures for this to be profitable)
